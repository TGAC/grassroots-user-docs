##Submit Measured Variables

Within an experiment various phenotypes can be measured and these are called **Measured Phenotype Variables**. Each of these consist of unique *triples* (three distinct pieces of information) that define:

 * A phenotype
 * How it has been measured 
 * Which units have been used

Before the Plots data that contains phenotypic values can be submitted, the required *Measured Variables* need to have been imported into the system. The form for submitting ontology terms is available at [https://grassroots.tools/private/service/field_trial-submit_measured_variables](https://grassroots.tools/private/service/field_trial-submit_measured_variables)

The data is submitted as a spreadsheet where each row contains the information for a single *Measured Variable* and the coumn headings are described below:


 * **Variable Identifier**:
