<p>As you start to type in the search box, treatments will be returned that match your query. This search system allows you to click on a row to copy the <strong>Variable Name</strong>, which can then be pasted as a column header in your spreadsheet, or any other documentation or publications. It is good practice to include these terms wherever possible as the Variable Name is unique, and this reduces ambiguity or confusion when describing your measurements or measurement method.</p>

<p>Start by typing the search phrase into the search box, results will appear below as a table. Select the row and press the copy button, the variable name of the row will be copied to the clipboard for you to paste into the plots page.</p>
