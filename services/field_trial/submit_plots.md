## Submitting Field Trial Plots

The form for submitting or editing existing Plots is available at  [https://grassroots.tools/private/service/field_trial-submit_plots](https://grassroots.tools/private/service/field_trial-submit_plots)

Plots can be added to the study using a table

![The form for submitting field trial plots](images/Image_2.png)

Firstly, select the study that you wish to add the plots for from the drop down menu. The table and form on the page below will load the existing plot information from the database.


The columns that the spreadsheet can contain are:

 * **Sowing date**: Sowing date of the plot in the format YYYY-MM-DD. If left blank, then the *Sowing date* specified for the Study will be used.
 * **Harvest date**: Harvest date of the plot in the format YYYY-MM-DD. If left blank, then the *Harvest date* specified for the Study will be used.
 * **Width**: This is the width, in metres, of each plot. If left blank, then the *Plot width* specified for the Study will be used.
 * **Length**: This is the length, in metres, of each plot. If left blank, then the *Plot length* specified for the Study will be used.
 * **Plot ID** *: The ID of the plot. This is a number given to uniquely identify each rack in the Study similar to a primary key in a database.
	If GeoJSON and/or images are available, this will be used to identify which plot this information refers to.
 * **Row** *: Row number of the plot. The numbering starts at 1 at the left-hand edge of the plots.
 * **Column** *: Column number of the plot. The numbering starts at 1 at the bottom-edge of the plots.
 * **Replicate**: Replicate number for this sample. This field can also have *control* to denote an experimental control sample.
 * **Rack** *: For the Plot at the given Row and Column, this is the number of the cassette that is filled with the material to sow before drilling.
 * **Accession**: This is the unique identifier from a particular seed/gene bank to identify the material. Currently the Germplasm Resource Unit (GRU) at the John Innes Centre is the only available seed bank, more will be added in the future, and the value that should be used is what they refer to as the *Accession Name*. For example, for the material detailed [here](https://www.seedstor.ac.uk/search-infoaccession.php?idPlant=39145) the accession name is *PW468-84-1-15-Q2B-MATU-P*. If the accession can be found in the GRU, it will change the background colour to green otherwise it will be blue.
 * **Comment**: Any comments for the plot.
 * **Image**: If there is a full-sized image of this plot, enter the web address of it here. If you need a web address to upload this to, please contact the Grassroots team so we can arrange to host the image.
 * **Thumbnail**: If there is a thumbnail image of this plot, enter the web address of it here. If you need a web address to upload this to, please contact the Grassroots team so we can arrange to host the image.
 * **Sowing order**: The order in which the plots were sown.
 * **Walking order**: The order in which the plots were walked between.

\* denotes the required values for each row in the spreadsheet.

All of the column headings are case-sensitive and the order of them in your spreadsheet does not matter. As well as these columns, you can also add columns to specify Treatment Factors, for crop treatments of the plot, and Measured Variables for phenotypic values.

### Treatment Factors

Treatment Factors can be added as extra columns. To specify the Treatment Factors to add search for the terms you want on the [Search Treatment Factors](https://grassroots.tools/docs/user/services/field_trial/search_treatments.md) page. The column headers that you need to put in the spreadsheet are the *Treatment Ontology* values from here.

For example, if you wanted to add *Nitrogen fertilizer exposure* as a Treatment Factor to the spreadsheet, you would search at the above page and get a similar view to the screenshot below

![Search for a Treatment](images/search_treatments_1.png)

Copy the value from the *Treatment Ontology* column, which in this example is *PECO:0007102* and add this as a column header to the plots spreadsheet

### Measured Variables

Measured Variables can be added as extra columns as follows:

![Add Measured Variables dialogue](images/Image_3.png)


To add data, make sure to add the [Measured Variables](https://grassroots.tools/public/service/field_trial-search_measured_variables) first. 
They can be found from the page in the link above. 

The first value in any of the column headers that you add must be the name of the Measured Variable. You can then add extra text to these headers to specify a date that the observation applies too and whether the values in this column are corrected, rather than raw, values. If the value was measured on a single date, then you can add a date here.  Likewise if the measurements were taken over a range of days, you can specify both a start and an end date. These dates can be in one of two formats: one for a day and one for a specfic time on a day.

For dates that refer to a day the format is **YYYY-MM-DD**, where *YYYY* is the 4-digit year, *MM* is the 2-digit month and *DD* is the 2-digit day of the month. If you wish to specify a time as well then the format is **YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss** where *hh* is the 2-digit hour, *mm* is the 2-digit minute and *ss* is the 2-digit second.

As well as adding dates you can also specify whether the values in the given column are raw or corrected values. By default, tthe values within a column are assumed to be raw values. You can change these to corrected values by adding *corrected* (all lower case) within the column header. Some examples are given below:


| Column | Description |
| -- -| --- |
| **PH_M_cm** | Plant height on unspecified date|
| **PH_M_cm 2020-12-01** | Plant height measured on 01 Dec 2020 |
| **PH_M_cm 2020-12-01 2020-12-03** | Plant height measured on 01 Dec 2020 to 03 Dec 2020.|
| **PH_M_cm corrected ** | Plant height corrected value on unspecified date|
| **PH_M_cm 2020-12-01T09:30:00** | Plant height measured on at 9:30 AM on 01 Dec 2020|
| **PH_M_cm 2020-12-01T09:30:00 2020-12-03T12:15:30** | Plant height measured from 9:30 AM 01 Dec 2020 to 12:15:30 PM on 03 Dec 2020.|
| **PH_M_cm 2020-12-01T09:30:00 corrected** | Corrected plant height measured on at 9:30 AM on 01 Dec 2020|
| **PH_M_cm 2020-12-01T09:30:00 2020-12-03T12:15:30 corrected** | Corrected plant height measured from 9:30 AM 01 Dec 2020 to 12:15:30 PM on 03 Dec 2020.|




Press "Add Row" for each row of the plots to be added with the relevant info, or you can download an Excel file to edit offline.


Once completed, a filled Excel file can be imported to the table using the drop zone above the table with the
            heading *Plot data to upload*. The table will then be filled with the information from the uploaded
            Excel file. The spreadsheet columns are matched by the column header name so it is important if a treatment
            is added make sure they are present in the web formâ€™s table too. The import will work without them but those
            columns will be ignored.

Importing through an Excel file will now be done at background without populating the table below the file drop area, after processing is done, a message will appear as below:
