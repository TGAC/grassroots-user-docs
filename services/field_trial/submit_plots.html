<p>Plots can be added to the study using a table:</p>

<p>Firstly, select the study from the drop down menu.</p>

<p>Then the table below will either load the plot info already in the database or showing empty. </p>

<p>To add data or import an Excel file, make sure to add the <u>Measured Variables</u> first. They can be found from the page in the link above, when a Measured Variable is entered in the above popup window (<i>e.g.</i> SLA_M_m2kg1), three new columns will be created in the table. These three columns are for the phenotypic value, the date in YYYY-MMM-DD format that the value was measured and a column for any corrected value that is calculated after further analysis. These columns are the name of the Measured Variable, the name followed by “ date” and the name followed by “ corrected”. So for our example Measured Variable above, the three columns would be: </p>

<ul><li><strong>SLA_M_m2kg1</strong>: This is the raw phenotypic value for SLA_M_m2kg1.</li>
<li><strong>SLA_M_m2kg1 date</strong>: This is the date in YYYY-MMM-DD format that the value was measured.</li>
<li><strong>SLA_M_m2kg1 corrected</strong>: If the value was subsequently adjusted, the update value is placed here. This entry can be blank.</li></ul>

<p>Press “Add Row” for each row of the plots to be added with the relevant info, or you can download an Excel file to edit offline.</p>

<p>Once completed, a filled Excel file can be imported to the table using the drop zone above the table with the heading <i>Plot data to upload</i>. The table will then be filled with the information from the uploaded Excel file. The spreadsheet columns are matched by the column header name so it is important if a treatment is added make sure they are present in the web form’s table too. The import will work without them but those columns will be ignored.</p>
