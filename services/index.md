##Introduction

The Grassroots infrastructure contains a variety of different services and the links to each of their individual sections of documentation are listed below.

 * **Search**: There is a service to search against all of the data, metadata and other services within a Grassroots instance and its documentation is available at [https://grassroots.tools/docs/user/services/search/](https://grassroots.tools/docs/user/services/search/).
 * **Field Trials**: This service provides a system for storing and searching for Field Trial experimental data. Its documentation is available at [https://grassroots.tools/docs/user/services/field_trial/index.md](https://grassroots.tools/docs/user/services/field_trial/index.md).
 * **Blast**:  The documentation for these services is available at [https://grassroots.tools/docs/user/services/blast](https://grassroots.tools/docs/user/services/blast). There are currently 3 BLAST Services:
   * **blastn** for searching nucleotide databases using nucleotide queries.
   * **blastp** for searching protein databases using protein queries.
   * **blastx** for searching protein databases using translated nucleotide queries.
 * **Samtools**: This service allows you to get the full named scaffold within a sequence. This service is automatically linked to results from our Blast services and can be run directly from there or also stand-alone. Our service can be access at [https://grassroots.tools/service/samtools-search](https://grassroots.tools/service/samtools-search). 
 * **Yellow Rust Field Pathogenomics**: This service shows the spread of the *Yellow Rust* field pathogen both geographically and temporally. [https://grassroots.tools/pathogenomics/descriptions.html](https://grassroots.tools/pathogenomics/descriptions.html). The service is available at [https://grassroots.tools/yellowrust-map/](https://grassroots.tools/yellowrust-map/).
